# Masters_Projects_BU_MS_AI
This is the repository for all my projects done during MS in Artificial Intelligence at Boston University (2021-2022).

## Methods to Detect GAN-Generated Image 

Description: The task was to analyze the state-of-the-art methods for the detection of GANs synthetic images, showing the key factors that create a successful approach, and compare methodsâ€™ performance over existing generative architecture.

This project was done for the course **CAS CS 523 Deep Learning** during my 2nd semester at BU.

Further details and code in the [folder](https://github.com/Aditya-Agrawal-8730/Masters_Projects_BU_MS_AI/tree/main/Methods%20to%20Detect%20GAN-Generated%20Images).

## Low Resource Language Text Classification

Description: The project consists of only 1437 news titles in Chichewa language as training instances, with 20 class labels, including: Politics, Social, Religion, Law/Order, etc. The goal is to successfully classify 620 news titles in Chichewa language into their correct class among the 20 classes.

This project was done for the course **CAS CS 505 Introduction to Natural Language Processing** during my 2nd semester at BU.

## Visual Odometry

Description: The challenge is to track the path of the camera using information from the videos captured. The algorithm is described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_odometry.

This project was done for the course **CAS CS 585 Image and Video Computing** during my 2nd semester at BU.

## Demographic Age and Race Prediction of Twitter Users

Description: Demographic (Age (<21 and >=21) and Race (black, white, Hispanic/Latino, Asian) prediction of Twitter users using their tweets and profile pictures.

This project was done for the course **GRS CS 640 Artificial Intelligence** during my 1st semester at BU.

Further details and code in the [folder](https://github.com/Aditya-Agrawal-8730/Masters_Projects_BU_MS_AI/tree/main/Demographic%20Age%20and%20Race%20Prediction%20of%20Twitter%20Users).
